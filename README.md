Feedback
Based on the lecturer feedback, I had to research and find some information to help me with the specific code. In the Part 1 assignment, I had an instruction to make the user request their previously inserted information for quantities to be reset to original values. So I had to gather some information to finding a code to correspond throughout the whole application.
There is also an feedback on the clearing of data for scaling, which I found out how to implement it on my code then after, displaying a command if the user wants to reset his/her data or not.
